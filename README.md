# SMILES-parser
A parser that checks the validity of SMILES strings and converts them into molecular graph representations.

See [`docs/smiles.md`](docs/smiles.md) for details on the SMILES specification and supported features.

## Parsing Specification and Rules
This parser was designed by following the [OpenSMILES specification](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html), [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Molecular_Input_Line_Entry_System), and the [U.S. EPA Examples](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html)
